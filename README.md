Hello. I'm currently writing several commonly used data structures into objects within the Lua programming language.
  I used JavaScript naming conventions for some of them, I don't really know why.
  
The majority of my time coding up to this point was done through the roblox platform using script executors(not illegal) and some Roblox Studio work.
Since Roblox uses Lua, I know the language well.

I eventually want to improve my knowledge on JavaScript, Python, and hope to learn either C or C++ one day. Who knows.
